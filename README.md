Let's write an experimental OS in Go!

## Building

There are several dependencies you need to install for this to work.

You need to install qemu-system-x86_64, vagrant and of course golang.

On MacOS with homebrew run these commands to install the dependencies.

        $ brew install qemu
        $ brew cask install virtualbox
        $ brew cask install vagrant
        $ brew cask install vagrant-manager

To build the OS, clone the repo, cd to it, install the dependencies and enter these two commands.

        $ vagrant up
        $ make run
